Every test release of Debian is codenamed sid.

The Debian project is developed over the internet by a community of volunteers in their free time lead by a Debian project leader
and following a Debian constituition, the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG) and the Debian Social Contract.

The Debian project was initially funded by the FSF and later on by the SPI, formed by the Debian project.

The major reasons why people choose Debian are:

- Debian is complete free software 
- Debian is a stable and secure linux operating system
- Debian has extensive hardware support
- Debian provides smooth upgrades
- Debian is the seed and base for many other distributions.
  Many of the most popular Linux distributions, like Ubuntu, Knoppix, PureOS, SteamOS or Tails, choose Debian as a base.
- The Debian project is a community.
  Debian is not only a Linux operating system. The software is co-produced by hundreds of volunteers from all over the world. Anyone can be part of the Debian community even if he/she is not a programmer or sysadmin. Debian is community and consensus driven and has a democratic governance structure. Since all Debian developers have equal rights it cannot be controlled by a single company. 

IoT and embedded devices supported by Debian include Raspberry Pi, variants of QNAP, mobile devices, home routers and a lot of Single Board Computers (SBC).

Debian supports multiple hardware architectures including amd64, i386, multiple versions of ARM and MIPS, RISC-V.
